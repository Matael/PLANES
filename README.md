# PLANES: Porous LAum NumEricaL simulator

PLANES is a simulation tool developped by [O. Dazel](http://perso.univ-lemans.fr/~odazel/)
and [others](#contributors) mainly in the LAUM ( [Laboratoire d'Acoustique de l'Universit√© du
Mans](http://laum.univ-lemans.fr/fr/index.html) ), Le Mans, France.

PLANES features a Finite Element Solver, a Discontinuous Galerkin with Plane Waves one and
a Plane Wave solver. Coupling between techniques is sometimes possible, but most probably
undocumented (or only partially).

Partial documentation can be found [on Read the Docs](http://planes.rtfd.io).
Reference documentation is to be found in the `TeX/` directory.

# Papers

Here is a small list of publications related to PLANES. Some of the method proposed in
these papers are implemented in the codebase, other papers just used PLANES as a
reference. The list might not be exhaustive.
